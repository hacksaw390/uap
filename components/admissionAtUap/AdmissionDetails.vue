          The admission screening procedure at UAP aims to find the most
          deserving students for each department. It is also important for
          students to find out their own skill sets which will suggest and guide
          them in choosing appropriate career path. The admission system varies
          for different departments depending on each departmentâ€™s requirements,
          but it is strictly maintained that the procedures are fair and
          transparent. We value that each student deserves a culture where all
          the classmates are motivated to pursue higher education and have
          something to offer in their lateral education. Good admission
          procedures are here to satisfy that.
