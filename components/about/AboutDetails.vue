            University of Asia Pacific (UAP) was established in 1996 as a
            private university under the Private University Act 1992, with a
            vision to enhance the opportunities for higher education in
            Bangladesh. Its curriculum has been approved by The University
            Grants Commission of the Government of the People's Republic of
            Bangladesh. The university started its operation, i.e. the first
            semester of classes, in 1996, and offered four-year bachelor degree
            programs in Computer Science and Technology and Business
            Administration only. Now UAP offers undergraduate programs in
            Architecture, Business Administration, Civil and Environmental
            Engineering, Computer Science and Engineering and Pharmacy.
            <br /><br />
            UAP has been sponsored by University of Asia Pacific Foundation, a
            non-profit, non-commercial organization based in Dhaka, Bangladesh.
            The principal aim of the Foundation is to promote human and social
            development through, inter alia, improved educational opportunities,
            innovative educational programs relevant to the needs of an emerging
            society and to develop skills, knowhow and awareness of the youth
            through appropriate institutional means.
